# Motion Detector

Motion Detector is a lightweight, real-time surveillance application developed using Python and OpenCV. It transforms your computerâ€™s webcam into a smart motion-tracking system that captures evidence and sends it via email alerts when movement is detected.

## Features

- **Real-Time Surveillance**: Constantly monitors video feed for motion using frame differencing.
- **Automated Snapshot Capture**: Stores key frames at the moment of detected activity.
- **Email Alerts**: Sends out automated email notifications with image evidence.
- **Multithreaded Design**: Ensures smooth performance through asynchronous processing.
- **Configurable Settings**: Easily customizable sensitivity, alert frequency, and mail configurations.

## Technologies Used

- **Computer Vision**: OpenCV
- **Backend**: Python
- **Web Layer**: Flask (optional UI)
- **System Design**: Modular architecture with multithreading
